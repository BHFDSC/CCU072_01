# Influence of COVID-19 on British burden of cardiovascular disease

## Project description

Healthcare planners need important epidemiological metrics for cardiovascular diseases like heart attack and stroke. To plan services, they need to know how often people have diseases of different types (‘incidence’), how severe these diseases are (‘case fatality’), and how many people are living with different diseases (‘prevalence’). The COVID 19 pandemic has influenced all of these measures through a combination of direct and indirect impacts on cardiovascular diseases. We aim to see how a range of diseases changed before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic.

We will calculate the incidence, case fatality and prevalence for a wide range of cardiovascular diseases, from the very rare to the very common. We will also see whether the estimates for commoner diseases like stroke and heart attack are different in people of different ethnicities, ages, levels of deprivation and sex in different regions of England. We will look at epidemiological metrics by years prior to the pandemic (before 2020), by months during the main phase of the pandemic (2020, 2021, 2022) and by years after the pandemic.
